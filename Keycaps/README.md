Icons, etc used to make custom keycaps.
Probably not open source licensed.

Main design was from this project:
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3630367

Opened design in FreeCAD and exported base keycap and added my icons in Fusion 360.

Used a combination of these apps to convert PNG -> SVG (-> Inkscape to resize) -> DXF to import into Fusion 360.
